1. Extract the contents of the zip file to the game directory.

2. Right click on the game in Steam and go to "Properties" -> "Set Launch
   Options" and enter "-window-mode exclusive" (without the quotes) and click
   "Ok"

3. Launch the game. The first time you run it (and again after any driver
   update) you will get a UAC prompt for Rundll32 to install the driver profile
   - choose yes.

4. If 3D Vision still does not kick in automatically, try pressing Alt+Enter
   twice.
